##Object Oriented To-Do List App

*But we already did this project!! Why are we doing it again!*?

Yes we did, but we didn't do it in the most efficient manner. What if you wanted to make 100 lists in the way we originally did it? You would have to copy and paste all of that code into 100 different files and run them all separately. That sounds sort of insane, doesn't it?

Object orientation is one of the most powerful concepts in programming, and today that power will be yours. You'll learn about how we can create 'blueprints' (known as classes) which build objects that mirror or model real world objects, relationships, and environments. Ever wonder how Facebook can have over one billion users, or how a video game can have hundreds of detailed characters? The answer is through object orientation.

By the end of this project, you will be able to use and explain the function of objects to model real-life structures.
